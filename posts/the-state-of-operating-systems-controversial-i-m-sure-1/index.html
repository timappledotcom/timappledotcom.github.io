<h2 id="historically-historically"><a href="#historically"></a>{#historically} Historically</h2>
<p>So I've been around for awhile now, at least a few decades of
adulthood. Most of that time I was a die hard Linux user. I had stints
of using Windows, especially back in the &quot;World of Warcraft&quot; days. But
most of my early years I was setting up PPP connections to my isp in
Slackware. My opinions on operating systems has changed drastically now
and I thought I would jot down what I am thinking about the topic at
this time.</p>
<h2 id="linux-linux"><a href="#linux"></a>{#linux} Linux</h2>
<p>Linux my dear old friend. I used to defend you with all I had. No matter
how difficult you were I would suggest you to everyone. Then as years
went on the difficulty went away. I think most anyone can successfully
get some version of Linux installed with very little effort. Not to
mention it is fairly easy to find preinstalled on a machine if need be.</p>
<p>...But, I find most applications inadequate for me these days. All the
best apps seem to be things created for other OS's ported over or they
are just web apps anyway.</p>
<p>Linux is much more a toy to tinker with to me these days. Of course
there is no denying it's versatility and performance on the server
side, nothing compares to be honest. On the desktop though, it's to
fragmented, the applications mostly to simple or to buggy. I just can't
bring myself to use it consistently.</p>
<p>Now do not be angry with me. I do love it, it's just not for me anymore
and I have become much less a freedom fighter in my old age.</p>
<h2 id="windows-windows"><a href="#windows"></a>{#windows} Windows</h2>
<p>The cursed enemy to all! Well not anymore. With close to a decade of new
leadership this boat has changed course completely. Not that it's all
rainbows and unicorns, but they are way more open, the OS is less buggy,
and in general it's actually become a pleasant experience.</p>
<p>Now with WSL if I do need to scratch that itch I can. I mostly open it
and <code>sudo apt update &amp;&amp; apt upgrade</code> . Then I close it again. For
development Python, Rust, Flutter/Dart, Node, and of course .Net all run
native and well for that matter. Not to mention the new Windows Terminal
really is an improvement. I like it much more than most of the Linux
terminals I've used.</p>
<p>All in all, I gotta say I like them these days and will continue to use
it as my daily driver.</p>
<h2 id="chromeos--chromeos-"><a href="#chromeos-"></a>{#chromeos-} ChromeOS ##</h2>
<p>Isn't that Linux? Well technically it is, but it's pretty well hidden.
This is my new love. I'm typing this on it now. It's fast, smooth,
pretty much trouble free. The occasional time I do bugger it up I can
literally reset it and be back to work in about 5 minutes.</p>
<p>On the Dev side, I can run GUI Linux apps on it. I actually run VSCode
and Android studio on it for Flutter development. With the bonus of
being able to run/test Android apps on it. I've also run Node, Deno and
Rust on it no problem.</p>
<p>Needless to say, ChromeOS is slowly becoming my favorite and I spend
just about as much time on it as I do on my main Windows machine. And
again, if I feel the urge to see packages update I can run my <code>sudo apt</code>
commands on it.</p>
<h2 id="android-android"><a href="#android"></a>{#android} Android</h2>
<p>This is my mobile operating system of choice, I really like the
ecosystem, I develop for it, and a couple other reasons to be mentioned
below. Besides the variety and price points I can get a real good phone
at.</p>
<h2 id="the-apple-ecosystem-the-apple-ecosystem"><a href="#the-apple-ecosystem"></a>{#the-apple-ecosystem} The Apple Ecosystem</h2>
<p>So all the Apple stuff. Just because I share a name with them doesn't
mean I have to like them. But I confess, I agree that they're hardware
is amazing. I have used iOS in the past and it's damn good. But they
are not necessarily the best. I find them more trendy than anything.</p>
<p>But the main reason I don't use them is elitism. I call myself a
developer and I want everyone in the world, no matter where they are
located or what their income is to have the opportunity to take
advantage of whatever awful software I may create in the future. I
really am not interested in using products that only the wealthier
people in the world can take advantage of.</p>
<p>Mind you, I have nice things. And they are expensive. I use a high spec
Surface Laptop. My Chromebook is a Pixelbook Go with real good specs.
But I know anywhere in the world the hardware and OS are available to
the general masses, maybe without the performance, but they can use the
stuff.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion-conclusion"><a href="#conclusion"></a>{#conclusion} Conclusion</h2>
<p>So as you may have noticed, this was very opinionated. It's literally
just where I am at with my computer use. I've used most operating
systems and like and dislike things about all of them. I do think
opensource and proprietary systems can coexist and that they both have
their own unique places they fit in the world. No reason to hate either.</p>
<p>P.S. BSD people, don't feel bad. I've used your OS also. And an
honorable mention for Haiku. Cheers!
