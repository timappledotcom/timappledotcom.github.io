<p>Yes, another title with no real meaning. I am seriously thinking of stopping half of my use of social media. “Half?” you may say. Yes, after getting myself in an iffy discussion today, I think my commenting days are over.</p>
<p>That is right, I think I am going to stop replying to social media posts. I will of course reply to comments on my own posts, but I realize now that unwelcome engagement is usually bad engagement.</p>
<p>Of course, ideally, the reply by email trend will continue, with me corresponding with others or they with me, to have friendly discussions about whatever the topic may be.</p>
<p>Cheers!</p>
