Why have I not heard of this until today? InCoWriMo or International Correspondence Writing Month sounds to be right up my alley. I love writing letters and there seem to be so few willing to get one, or want to respond to one at least. This is a whole group of folks who want to do just that.
It seems the idea is just to try to send out a letter every day of the month of February. They also do an address exchange every year for those looking for folks to correspond with. It really seems like a hoot, at least to me.">

<p>Why have I not heard of this until today? <a href="https://incowrimo.org/"><strong>InCoWriMo</strong> or <strong>International Correspondence Writing Month</strong></a> sounds to be right up my alley. I love writing letters and there seem to be so few willing to get one, or want to respond to one at least. This is a whole group of folks who want to do just that.</p>
<p>It seems the idea is just to try to send out a letter every day of the month of February. They also do an <a href="https://incowrimo.org/2025/01/incowrimo-address-exchange-2025/">address exchange</a> every year for those looking for folks to correspond with. It really seems like a hoot, at least to me.</p>
<p>I’m late on it this year, not officially in the mix or anything. But I’m going to try to send as much snail mail out as I can this month in the spirit of things. I have a bunch of nice writing paper just sitting and waiting to be used. I will have to run and pick up some stamps.</p>
<p>If by chance you want me to babble to you with a pen and ink instead of on here, feel free to visit my <a href="https://timapple.com/pages/contact">contact page</a> and include a mailing address, and I’ll write something to you. If you know I have no clue who you are, go ahead and maybe add some things of interest or even how your week or day has been, so I have something to start with. Oh, and a warning, my penmanship stinks.</p>
<p>Cheers!</p>
