This evening, I listened to the song I Believe by Andrea Bocelli and Katherine Jenkins. I am always so moved when I listen to this song—the blend of those fantastic vocals and the lyrics that touch my heart so profoundly. The entire piece makes me melt. I’m not sure if you have heard the song, but I just wanted to share some of those lyrics.

<p>This evening, I listened to the song <em>I Believe</em> by Andrea Bocelli and Katherine Jenkins. I am always so moved when I listen to this song—the blend of those fantastic vocals and the lyrics that touch my heart so profoundly. The entire piece makes me melt. I’m not sure if you have heard the song, but I just wanted to share some of those lyrics.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One day I’ll hear The laugh of children In a world where war has been banned</p>
<p>One day I’ll see Men of all colors Sharing words of love and devotion</p></blockquote>
<p>and</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Open your heart To those who need you In the name of love and devotion</p>
<p>Yes, I believe</p>
<p>I believe in the people Of all nations To join and to care For love</p>
<p>I believe in a world Where light will guide us And giving our love We’ll make heaven on earth</p></blockquote>
<p>Someday when you have the time, put the song on and meditate on those lyrics if we could all make something so beautiful manifest, truly making heaven on earth.</p>
