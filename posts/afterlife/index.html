I just finished the series Afterlife about a widower who is having trouble getting beyond the loss of his wife. It has to be one of the greatest love stories I have ever watched, even with the ridiculous amount of foul language it contains. It’s funny how Ricky Gervais can offend yet still break my heart. I just found it to be such a moving little series that it is definitely worth the watch. But I’m sad it is over. I really recommend it. If you’re offended by foul language, you may want to avoid it.">
