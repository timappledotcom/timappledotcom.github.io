<p>Let me first address the actual fact that though I am not a “Gamer”, I do play video games from time to time and have even lost a few months of my life to World of Warcraft more than once. But this morning I had an encounter with a friendly fella on Bluesky that went on a short tangent about video games being good or bad, health benefits, and the like.</p>

<p>For some years now, almost every book I’ve read is non-fiction. I’ve read a ton of tech books, books on health, and some history mainly. I’m reading my first work of fiction in some time right now.</p>
<p>I wonder if I should be reading more fiction. Furthermore, I wonder what, if any, benefit fiction may have over non-fiction? Or are they the same? It makes me wonder. When I was young, I read so many fantasy and sci-fi books. It was almost all I consumed, of course that was my peak Dungeons &amp; Dragons era also.</p>

<p><em>This is a repost, I was going to separate tech stuff from regular day to day, but screw it, I’m going to slop all the stuff together.</em></p>
<p>Either way, I’m pondering the never ending OS question, yet again, in my life. I’m currently running Windows due to a requirement for a SANS course I’m taking, but I long to throw Linux back on my machine. At the same time, I have a slight craving to delve into the Mac world, though the pricing consistently keeps me away. And I do the same with phones, mind you, I have both an Android and iPhone I hop back and forth between.</p>

<p>I’ve come to the conclusion I follow way too many sites, people, or products on social media. I find myself scrolling the different sites and rarely stopping, mainly because I am uninterested. And I’m on a few networks, Nostr, Threads, Mastodon, BlueSky, and Facebook.</p>
<p>If I’m not stopping a lot, it because I am uninterested, or it’s repetitive, at least that’s my assumption. On almost all but Facebook, which I will explain later, I initially followed a lot of accounts I thought would be interesting, so there would be something in the feed initially. This has backfired for what I consider one major reason, I misjudged my own interests.</p>

<p>I’ve used <a href="https://proton.me">Proton</a> Mail on and off for a few years now. The premium package is pretty handy and comes with a bunch of extra services, there is no doubt it is worth the money if that is what you&rsquo;re looking for.</p>
<p>I’ve also been a <a href="https://hey.com">“Hey!”</a> customer for some time, and had sort of split my personal and internet persona between the two. As time goes on, I find this unnecessary, since my internet persona is me and not some secret alt. And though I will lose a bunch of bells and whistles leaving Proton, I just like “Hey!” much better functionally. It’s just a fun way to deal with email.

<p>Well, it’s here, 2025. It seems like Y2K was just yesterday and we all the world was going to end, wasn’t that a laugh. To be honest, I don’t have much planned for 2025. We just moved to Texas, and hopefully we are done with moving for some time.</p>
<p>Career, work, or just being productive wise, I have two more SANS certs to complete in the next five months. Hopefully I will be back in the gainfully employed world not long after that.</p>

<p>And the trial of new blogging products continues. I recently just heard of Pika and figured I would give it a peek. It seems to hold to the original ideals of <a href="https://ghost.io">Ghost</a> when it first came out. Just a simple place to write and post from.</p>
<p>Playing around with the interface so far, I like it. It’s simple and clean. I will have to play around with it a lot more to see if it truly fits my needs. I was going to use ghost, but in all reality it’s pretty expensive, and I’m not going to be having a ton of people paying to read what I write, so why bother.</p>
