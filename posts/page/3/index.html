<p>So back in 2019 at peak covid our family moved from Dallas Texas to Staten Island, New York, where we stayed three years. I’m not the biggest fan of NYC, but it was a pleasant stint in the Big Apple. From there we moved to Huntington, West Virginia. This was one of the most beautiful places I have ever lived. Unfortunately, it doesn’t offer much beyond its looks, and we lasted there for six months. I still miss the place a little.</p>

<p>And the trial of new blogging products continues. I recently just heard of Pika and figured I would give it a peek. It seems to hold to the original ideals of <a href="https://ghost.io">Ghost</a> when it first came out. Just a simple place to write and post from.</p>
<p>Playing around with the interface so far, I like it. It’s simple and clean. I will have to play around with it a lot more to see if it truly fits my needs. I was going to use ghost, but in all reality it’s pretty expensive, and I’m not going to be having a ton of people paying to read what I write, so why bother.</p>

<p>I joined the Baha’i Faith in 2010. After a childhood growing up Catholic, my stint in high school as a proclaimed atheist, to a seeker after my time in the army, finally finding and falling in love with the Baha’i Faith. As I now read the history of the faith and its writings, I think back to being a soldier.</p>
<p>On March 20th, 2003, I crossed over the border from Kuwait to Iraq for the first time. I was a ball of fear, excitement, and wonder all rolled up in one. I spent most of the first few days in the back of a Bradley fighting vehicle. I remember seeing a sign telling us that we were atop Babylon, which all I could see was sand and some old brick walls scattered about in the region. With the occasional view of MLRS rocket systems sending volleys and feeling sorry for those on the receiving end. Other than knowing the name Babylon, it held no significance to me on that day.</p>

<p>This evening, I listened to the song <em>I Believe</em> by Andrea Bocelli and Katherine Jenkins. I am always so moved when I listen to this song—the blend of those fantastic vocals and the lyrics that touch my heart so profoundly. The entire piece makes me melt. I’m not sure if you have heard the song, but I just wanted to share some of those lyrics.</p>

<p>I just finished the series <a href="https://www.netflix.com/us/title/80998491?s=a%02trkid=13747225%02t=more%02vlang=en%002clip=81516682">Afterlife</a> about a widower who is having trouble getting beyond the loss of his wife. It has to be one of the greatest love stories I have ever watched, even with the ridiculous amount of foul language it contains. It’s funny how Ricky Gervais can offend yet still break my heart. I just found it to be such a moving little series that it is definitely worth the watch. But I’m sad it is over. I really recommend it. If you’re offended by foul language, you may want to avoid it.</p>

<p>Today I stumbled upon a great little movie I didn’t know existed. The story of a young Pakistani boy in England whose life is inspired by Bruce Springsteen. I really did enjoy it. If you are a Springsteen fan or like stories about immigrant families, you will really enjoy it, I think.</p>

<p>For those of you who are curious about other faiths or religions, I wanted to share a nine-episode podcast series I recently finished called <a href="https://bahaiteachings.org/podcasts/ambassador-to-humanity/"><em>Ambassador to Humanity</em></a>. It’s available on Spotify, Apple, and most other popular podcatchers. It recounts the life and work of Abdu’l-Baha, the son of Baha’u’llah, the founder of the <a href="https://bahai.org">Baha’i Faith</a>, and the authorized interpreter of His teachings.</p>
<p>He was loved by Muslims, Jews, Christians, and many more. He lived a life of service to humanity. As I sat and listened to each episode, each one made me cry to myself silently as I would think what it would be like to have been in his presence, or if I could live up to his example, and very much reminded me that I haven’t. I really cannot express the amount of love I felt just from stories of people who had encountered Him.</p>

<p>I’ve never really owned land, in the big sense. Nothing more than a backyard for me. But I do know people who have some, and they have been kind enough to let me pretend it was mine for short periods. Well, maybe they didn’t know I was pretending it was mine. But nonetheless they let me make use of it freely. I believe there is nothing better than being free to experience a place with no limits. To have free rein to do what you wish.</p>
