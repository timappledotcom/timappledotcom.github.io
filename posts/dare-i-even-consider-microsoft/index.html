For some reason, today, I have been pondering a return to Microsoft Products. I mean, I’ve been running Windows for some time now. I’m not sure if that is going to end anytime soon for that matter. Things like Linux have lost their luster for me. I like Apple devices, but I think Macs are a rip off. Microsoft/Windows is like that “jack of all trades”.
I’ve been paying for Office365 for years and don’t even use OneDrive, mainly because it’s a Microsoft Product; Instead I jump around from pCloud, Mega, Proton Drive, and various others. None that I am completely happy with in the end. At least OneDrive is seamless with my OS, and if I use it, Windows will stop nagging me to. It’s pretty much cross-platform also.">

<p>For some reason, today, I have been pondering a return to Microsoft Products. I mean, I’ve been running Windows for some time now. I’m not sure if that is going to end anytime soon for that matter. Things like Linux have lost their luster for me. I like Apple devices, but I think Macs are a rip off. Microsoft/Windows is like that “jack of all trades”.</p>
<p>I’ve been paying for Office365 for years and don’t even use OneDrive, mainly because it’s a Microsoft Product; Instead I jump around from pCloud, Mega, Proton Drive, and various others. None that I am completely happy with in the end. At least OneDrive is seamless with my OS, and if I use it, Windows will stop nagging me to. It’s pretty much cross-platform also.</p>
<p>I jump around note-taking products regularly also; none completely satisfy me. OneNote again integrates well with my OS and is cross-platform pretty much. It’s not the best, but if I’m going to be dissatisfied, it may as well not cost me extra.</p>
<p>Outlook mail, now that is another thing.. I don’t think I will ever use it as my main mail service, I love “Hey!”, but I can use it for may alternate junk address instead of paying for SimpleLogin. Why the hell not, I already have it. It makes me wonder why I keep paying extra for things I already have a solution for.</p>
<p>I’ve been using Apple Reminders for my to-do lists for groceries and such. It is 100% not cross-platform, I can only use it on my iPhone or the iCloud web interface, which blows! In comes Microsoft To-do, possibly? It’s cross-platform and pretty much provides the same functionality. Again, why am I forcing myself to use apps that make my life more difficult.</p>
<p>And there are other things, like being able to access my desktop from my phone, which is pretty cool, though I don’t know if I would ever need to use it. I already use all the office apps, let’s not kid ourselves saying the alternatives are better or that anyone else will ever take that market share anytime soon.</p>
<p>Maybe it’s because I’m old, and I’m sick of fighting with things. I don’t really know, and as the title states, I’m considering, not doing. It does sound like the right course at this point, though. I will ponder it further while I wait from the replies of the masses telling me how evil Microsoft is and how they are selling all my info. I’m pretty cynical these days, and I’m pretty sure everyone is selling our info if they can. It’s just assumed at this point. Let loose with the explanations of my insanity. I am awaiting.</p>
<p>Cheers!</p>
