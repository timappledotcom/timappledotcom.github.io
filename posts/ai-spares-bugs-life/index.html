So, I don’t use ChatGPT for anything serious these days, but today I discovered this guy crawling on one my dog Hazel’s prize turds.

I uploaded the picture into Copilot, and it initially said an Assassin bug. So then I started searching and found nothing matching. So then I searched Assassin bug larvae and bingo it showed up.
Come to find out, with further questions to ChatGPT it was a Wheel Bug larvae, and they are cold killers of other pesty insects and invasive species. They are said to have a very painful bite, but are non-aggressive.">

<p>With this information I spared said bugs life and separated him from the turd that did need to leave the yard. Copilot is now this bugs hero.</p>
