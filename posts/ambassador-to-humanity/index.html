For those of you who are curious about other faiths or religions, I wanted to share a nine-episode podcast series I recently finished called Ambassador to Humanity. It’s available on Spotify, Apple, and most other popular podcatchers. It recounts the life and work of Abdu’l-Baha, the son of Baha’u’llah, the founder of the Baha’i Faith, and the authorized interpreter of His teachings.
He was loved by Muslims, Jews, Christians, and many more. He lived a life of service to humanity. As I sat and listened to each episode, each one made me cry to myself silently as I would think what it would be like to have been in his presence, or if I could live up to his example, and very much reminded me that I haven’t. I really cannot express the amount of love I felt just from stories of people who had encountered Him.">

<p>For those of you who are curious about other faiths or religions, I wanted to share a nine-episode podcast series I recently finished called <a href="https://bahaiteachings.org/podcasts/ambassador-to-humanity/"><em>Ambassador to Humanity</em></a>. It’s available on Spotify, Apple, and most other popular podcatchers. It recounts the life and work of Abdu’l-Baha, the son of Baha’u’llah, the founder of the <a href="https://bahai.org">Baha’i Faith</a>, and the authorized interpreter of His teachings.</p>
<p>He was loved by Muslims, Jews, Christians, and many more. He lived a life of service to humanity.

I really cannot express the amount of love I felt just from stories of people who had encountered Him.</p>
<p>I’m not trying to push a sales pitch for the Baha’i faith; It is a chance to hear what kind of people we can strive to be, no matter our faith or even lack of it. Honestly, it is worth listening to and a significant part of our history. I hope you enjoy it.</p>
