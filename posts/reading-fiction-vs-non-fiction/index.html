For some years now, almost every book I’ve read is non-fiction. I’ve read a ton of tech books, books on health, and some history mainly. I’m reading my first work of fiction in some time right now.
I wonder if I should be reading more fiction. Furthermore, I wonder what, if any, benefit fiction may have over non-fiction? Or are they the same? It makes me wonder. When I was young, I read so many fantasy and sci-fi books. It was almost all I consumed, of course that was my peak Dungeons &amp; Dragons era also.">

<p>For some years now, almost every book I’ve read is non-fiction. I’ve read a ton of tech books, books on health, and some history mainly. I’m reading my first work of fiction in some time right now.</p>
<p>I wonder if I should be reading more fiction. Furthermore, I wonder what, if any, benefit fiction may have over non-fiction? Or are they the same? It makes me wonder. When I was young, I read so many fantasy and sci-fi books. It was almost all I consumed, of course that was my peak Dungeons &amp; Dragons era also.</p>
<p>My creativity is lacking these days, at least that is how I feel. Maybe reading more fiction would give my creative side a proverbial swift kick in the arse. Then again, maybe reading fiction vs nonfiction doesn’t matter as long as one is reading.</p>
<p>What do you read more of? Any thoughts on the topic? Please drop me a <a href="https://timapple.com/pages/contact">note</a> and share.</p>
<p>Cheers!</p>
