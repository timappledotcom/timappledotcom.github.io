<p>Either way, I’m pondering the never ending OS question, yet again, in my life. I’m currently running Windows due to a requirement for a SANS course I’m taking, but I long to throw Linux back on my machine. At the same time, I have a slight craving to delve into the Mac world, though the pricing consistently keeps me away. And I do the same with phones, mind you, I have both an Android and iPhone I hop back and forth between.</p>
<p>In the end, Linux usually wins in my mind for philosophical reasons. But I crave the other two from time to time. Sometimes it’s purely out of convenience, and others because I want to try something not available to me on Linux. The consistency of the others sometimes lures me also, no need to pontificate over which desktop I should use, let alone distro.</p>
<p>And then let’s not get into other devices, like my AirPods, my two HomePods, the Alexa that sits unplugged somewhere, my Apple Watch, Pixel Buds, etc… I have a plethora of things that work sometimes outside their ecosystem but are much friendlier and functional in their own little bubble. This goes for services also now that I think of it.</p>
<p>How does one pick and stick with one OS? I guess it would be simpler if you didn’t follow tech news and were unaware of all the new and shiny services or apps that may be out there. But when you look at the breadth of the technology space, there is so much. I will give it to Linux, when it comes to the technical space, it can do it all usually, but when it comes to gadgets and such, it maybe can be more difficult.</p>
<p>In the end, I guess I will always be a Linux guy, and I can&rsquo;t wait till I can get off using Windows from the day to day. I guess someday I may just need to have more than one machine, or something with a few drives so I can have all the operating systems. Only time will tell, I guess.</p>
