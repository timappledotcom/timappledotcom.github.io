So back in 2019 at peak covid our family moved from Dallas Texas to Staten Island, New York, where we stayed three years. I’m not the biggest fan of NYC, but it was a pleasant stint in the Big Apple. From there we moved to Huntington, West Virginia. This was one of the most beautiful places I have ever lived. Unfortunately, it doesn’t offer much beyond its looks, and we lasted there for six months. I still miss the place a little.">

<p>So back in 2019 at peak covid our family moved from Dallas Texas to Staten Island, New York, where we stayed three years. I’m not the biggest fan of NYC, but it was a pleasant stint in the Big Apple. From there we moved to Huntington, West Virginia. This was one of the most beautiful places I have ever lived. Unfortunately, it doesn’t offer much beyond its looks, and we lasted there for six months. I still miss the place a little.</p>
<p>We ended up in Beloit, Wisconsin where we have been exactly a year. It’s ten minutes from where I grew up, and I have a few wonderful friends here that I hadn’t seen in ages. Though I did see them some, I quickly realized that now we’re in our fifties and the days of loitering at each other’s homes and showing up unannounced are over. We all have kids, jobs, and many other responsibilities. They were the only reason to possibly stick around, but it really wasn’t happening. The four times we hung out in a year wasn’t really worth staying in the area, better to visit.</p>
<p>So now, two days before Christmas, we will be moving back to Texas, the place that is really more our home. Neither my wife nor I were born there, but our children were. So the natives out number us. We’ve finally dropped the renter life after thirteen years and bought ourselves a house, hoping to dig in some roots for the kids; who, if it all goes smooth, will get to spend Christmas and Christmas Eve in their new home. Bonus, they don’t have to share a room anymore. So everyone, have a Merry Christmas! Here’s to new beginnings.</p>
