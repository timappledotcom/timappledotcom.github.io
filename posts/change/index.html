Too much change, too fast. I like things to move slower. Not that I fear change, once I&rsquo;ve decided to change, I may move quicker than most. But until the time comes, I&rsquo;m a slow roller. I have to ease my mind into things, bring myself to accept them.

<p>Sometimes I wish my mind moved quicker, but I&rsquo;m the tortoise in this race. Everyone out there, be patient. I’m on my way.</p>
