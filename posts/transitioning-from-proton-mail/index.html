I’ve used Proton Mail on and off for a few years now. The premium package is pretty handy and comes with a bunch of extra services, there is no doubt it is worth the money if that is what you&rsquo;re looking for.

<p>I’ve used <a href="https://proton.me">Proton</a> Mail on and off for a few years now. The premium package is pretty handy and comes with a bunch of extra services, there is no doubt it is worth the money if that is what you&rsquo;re looking for.</p>
<p>I’ve also been a <a href="https://hey.com">“Hey!”</a> customer for some time, and had sort of split my personal and internet persona between the two. As time goes on, I find this unnecessary, since my internet persona is me and not some secret alt. And though I will lose a bunch of bells and whistles leaving Proton, I just like “Hey!” much better functionally. It’s just a fun way to deal with email. It’s just a fun way to deal with email.</p>
<p>Another thing is I already pay for other services that offer me the same thing Proton does (minus all the encryption on some), a big chunk coming from Apple who get a lot of my money anyway, may as well use the stuff. Not to mention my five hundred gigs of lifetime <a href="https://pcloud.com">pCloud</a> storage I paid for years ago that can replace Proton Drive.</p>
<p>In the end, I just don’t see the point to paying for a bunch of services that all do the same thing, and “Hey!” really does email good, it wins at that game hands down. So, I’m transitioning from Proton slowly, but I think it will be gone from all my systems in the next few months.</p>
<p>Cheers!</p>
